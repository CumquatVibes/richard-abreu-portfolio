  ============================================
  DISABLED — Fake purchase notifications removed.

  These showed fabricated "X from Y just purchased Z" messages
  with random timestamps, which is deceptive and can hurt
  store trust and Google's E-E-A-T signals.

  Replace with real Shopify notification apps that pull
  actual order data if social proof is needed.
