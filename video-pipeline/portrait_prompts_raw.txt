An ultra-realistic startup office interior portrait in a mandatory 16:9 aspect ratio, designed for precise subject placement. The person given in the reference image is seated directly behind a natural wood desk, perfectly centered and facing straight toward the camera in a strict front view. Framing is a medium close-up composition (chest to head) while the entire desk remains fully visible in the frame. Full head and hair are clearly visible with no cropping. The subject’s identity must match the reference exactly — facial structure, skin tone, hairstyle, hairline, age, and proportions remain unchanged.
The subject presents a focused yet approachable professional expression, suitable for a startup or modern business environment. Posture is upright and natural. Hands are loosely folded on the desk in a relaxed, believable manner. Skin is rendered with visible pores, subtle imperfections, accurate highlights, and realistic shadow behavior — no artificial smoothing or enhancement. Hair detail is natural and precise, with individual strands visible. Clothing remains simple and contemporary, with realistic fabric texture and natural folds.
The environment reflects an authentic startup workspace. A natural wood desk is fully visible and centered, styled with an open laptop (back facing, centered), a smartphone, and a notebook arranged naturally. The background wall is painted a muted soft blue, providing a calm, modern tone. Simple wooden shelves directly behind the desk hold books and small plants, arranged cleanly and symmetrically. The background remains readable yet secondary to the subject.
Lighting is realistic and physically believable. Balanced natural daylight blends seamlessly with subtle overhead illumination, producing accurate white balance, soft shadows, and realistic light falloff across the room and the subject’s face.
Depth of field is shallow yet realistic, keeping the subject sharply focused while softly separating the background without breaking spatial realism. The camera angle is eye-level and perfectly straight-on, reinforcing a clean, centered editorial composition.
Captured in a high-end full-frame or cinema-class camera style, delivering true native 8K clarity, zero noise, extreme sharpness, natural micro-contrast, accurate color science, and premium photographic realism.
The final result is strictly photorealistic — no CGI look, no illustration, no stylization, no artificial smoothing, and no artifacts — indistinguishable from a real professional startup office photograph.

Master Prompt for add person :
Output in ultra-high resolution, correct aspect ratio.The integration of the human subject into the generated background must be executed with perfect realism, ensuring the subject's scale, perspective, and depth align seamlessly with the environment to eliminate any pasted appearance. Crucially, the lighting must be an exact match, mirroring the background's direction, intensity, and color temperature, complemented by the addition of soft contact shadows and subtle environmental light spill on the subject's skin and clothing. Furthermore, all edges must be blended flawlessly, avoiding halos or artifacts, while maintaining natural skin texture and realistic fabric details; the camera angle, lens perspective, and depth of field must also be precisely matched to the new setting. The ultimate goal is a single, ultra-high-resolution, cinematic, and fully photorealistic photograph, devoid of any discernible AI artifacts.







1. Prompt:
“A cinematic, ultra-realistic portrait of a young man standing outdoors at dusk, framed in a 16:9 wide aspect ratio. The subject is centered, holding a smartphone in one hand close to his chest, softly illuminating his face with a warm glow. He has short, neatly styled hair, smooth skin texture, and a calm, focused expression, looking slightly downward toward the phone with a subtle, confident gaze.
Around him, floating holographic social media icons hover in mid-air — Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, likes, hearts, and notification symbols — glowing in vibrant neon colors (red, blue, pink, and cyan). These icons emit soft light rays and faint particles, creating a futuristic, digital aura. Small glowing dust particles and light specks drift through the air, enhancing the magical, tech-driven atmosphere.
The lighting is cinematic and dramatic:
   * Primary warm key light from the phone screen illuminating the face
   * Cool ambient rim light separating the subject from the background
   * Subtle volumetric lighting and glow effects around the icons
The background is softly blurred with shallow depth of field, suggesting an urban or residential outdoor environment at night, with smooth bokeh lights and a dark teal-blue color palette. Contrast is high, with rich shadows and controlled highlights, giving a modern editorial look.
Shot with a cinematic lens (50mm–85mm look), f/1.8, shallow depth of field, sharp focus on the subject’s face and hands, ultra-detailed skin texture, realistic lighting falloff, and high dynamic range.

 Futuristic, digital influence, modern social media culture, cinematic realism, tech-inspired storytelling, clean and professional visual tone.
Quality Tags:
 Ultra-realistic, cinematic lighting, high detail, HDR, professional photography, film still, dramatic atmosphere, modern aesthetic.”
  

2. Prompt:
“Create a cinematic, ultra-realistic portrait in 16:9 aspect ratio, featuring a confident, well-groomed man standing centered against a dark studio backdrop with a subtle gradient of deep charcoal and soft red accent light.
The subject is a smiling adult man wearing a tailored navy-blue business suit, crisp white dress shirt, and a dark patterned tie. He is holding a large blank white rectangular board with both hands at chest level, facing the camera directly. His posture is upright and confident, shoulders relaxed, expression warm and approachable.
Lighting:
 Use professional studio lighting with a dual-tone setup:

3. Prompt:
“A cinematic, high-contrast black-and-white portrait of a thoughtful man seated at a chess table, captured in a moody indoor environment. The subject is positioned at the center of the frame, leaning slightly forward, holding a single chess piece delicately between his fingers mid-move, while his other hand rests against his forehead, expressing deep concentration and strategic tension.
The chessboard fills the lower foreground, with realistic wooden chess pieces arranged in an active mid-game position. The surface of the table subtly reflects the pieces, adding depth and realism. The subject’s facial expression is intense and introspective, eyes locked toward the board and camera line, conveying intelligence, pressure, and quiet determination.
Lighting is low-key and dramatic, using a soft directional side light from one side of the face to sculpt facial features, emphasizing skin texture, wrinkles, and shadows. The opposite side of the face fades gently into darkness, creating a classic film-noir aesthetic. The background is naturally dark and softly blurred, with no visible studio elements, maintaining a realistic indoor atmosphere.
The overall tone is monochromatic, with rich blacks, soft greys, and clean highlights. Shallow depth of field isolates the subject and chessboard from the background, creating a strong cinematic focus. No color accents, no green screen, no artificial backdrops.

“Ultra-cinematic dramatic portrait of a mature man with a short gray beard and intense expression, centered in frame, holding an open newspaper that is actively burning along its edges. Flames rise naturally from the paper, casting warm orange and golden firelight onto his face, hands, and chest.
The subject stares directly into the camera with a calm yet powerful gaze, conveying control, mystery, and quiet dominance. Fire sparks, glowing embers, and subtle smoke particles float through the air, adding motion and atmosphere.
Lighting is highly cinematic: the fire itself acts as the primary key light, illuminating facial contours and skin texture, while a soft, low-intensity ambient fill light separates the subject from a deep, dark background. Shadows are rich and dramatic, with high contrast and warm highlights.
The background is a dark, neutral night setting, softly blurred, with faint bokeh glows barely visible in the distance. No visible text overlays, no logos, no watermarks.
Composition is a medium close-up (chest to head), perfectly centered, with symmetrical balance.
Visual style is cinematic realism, editorial, high contrast, film-grade color science, warm fire tones against cool dark shadows.
Shot on a virtual 50mm lens, shallow depth of field, sharp focus on eyes, face, flames, and newspaper texture.
Aspect ratio: 16:9
 Ultra-detailed, photorealistic, dramatic, cinematic lighting, intense mood.”

One hand casually placed in his trouser pocket, posture relaxed yet powerful.
The background is a deep crimson-red studio backdrop, filled with floating gold metallic confetti captured mid-air, creating a celebratory, luxury fashion moment. Confetti reflects warm highlights and adds depth through layered foreground and background elements.
Lighting is cinematic and controlled: warm key light illuminating the face and upper torso, soft fill to preserve skin texture, and subtle rim light separating the subject from the red background. Skin tones are natural and detailed, facial hair crisp, expression calm and self-assured, gaze slightly above camera for editorial impact.
Shot on a high-end cinema camera look, shallow depth of field, sharp subject focus with soft background falloff. High-contrast color grading, premium fashion campaign style, Vogue-level editorial quality, clean studio environment, no text, no logos, no watermark.”

The subject is positioned slightly off-center, framed from the chest up, with shoulders relaxed and body turned subtly to the side. He has short dark hair, a well-groomed full beard, and is wearing thin, clear rectangular eyeglasses. His clothing is minimal and natural — a simple light-colored (off-white) t-shirt with soft fabric texture visible.
His facial expression is calm, thoughtful, and relaxed, with a gentle half-smile. His gaze is directed slightly upward and away from the camera, creating a reflective, peaceful mood.
Lighting is warm golden-hour sunlight, coming from the side, creating soft low-key side lighting across the face. The light highlights natural skin texture, cheekbones, and beard detail, while casting gentle shadows that add depth without harsh contrast.
