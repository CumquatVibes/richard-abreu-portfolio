First, those modern synths gotta go. We're swapping them for real instruments: a wah-wah guitar, a punchy bass, and those signature disco strings.

The mixing philosophy also shifts. We're aiming for that warm, analog sound, layering everything carefully to create a rich, full sonic experience. We need to capture the Motown soul that defined the era!
