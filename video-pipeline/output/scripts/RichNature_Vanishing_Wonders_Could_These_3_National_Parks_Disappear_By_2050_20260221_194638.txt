**Narrator:** Imagine a world without the majestic landscapes we cherish. A world where the very icons of nature, the places we’ve designated as protected havens, are… gone. Shockingly, scientists predict that by 2050, some of the world's most iconic national parks could be drastically altered, potentially unrecognizable, and some… might even disappear entirely. We’re talking about irreversible changes. Join us as we explore three national parks facing an existential threat and what this means for the future of our planet. Get ready to witness the vanishing wonders.

## Chapter 1: Everglades National Park: A Drowning Paradise (0:30-4:30)

**Narrator:** Welcome to Everglades National Park, a sprawling wetland paradise spanning over 1.5 million acres of southern Florida. This unique ecosystem, home to a diverse array of wildlife, including the Florida panther, American crocodile, and countless bird species, is a crucial habitat and a vital component of South Florida's water supply. But the Everglades is facing a silent, relentless enemy: rising sea levels.

**Narrator:** The primary culprit? Climate change, of course, causing glaciers and ice sheets to melt at an alarming rate. This influx of water is inundating coastal areas worldwide, and the low-lying Everglades are particularly vulnerable. Projections indicate that sea levels around the Everglades could rise by as much as 1 to 3 feet by 2050. This might not sound like much, but for a park that barely averages 3 feet above sea level, it's catastrophic.

**Narrator:** The consequences are already being felt. Saltwater intrusion is creeping inland, poisoning freshwater ecosystems. Mangrove forests, which act as natural barriers against storms and provide crucial habitat for marine life, are dying off. The delicate balance of freshwater and saltwater that defines the Everglades is being disrupted, threatening the survival of countless species. For example, the Cape Sable seaside sparrow, already an endangered species, is losing its nesting habitat to the encroaching saltwater. As the saltwater moves inland, the freshwater peat soils begin to break down and release stored carbon dioxide, further exacerbating the climate change problem.

**Narrator:** What will the Everglades look like in 2050? Experts predict a significantly reduced land area, with vast swaths of the park submerged. The iconic sawgrass prairies could become saltwater marshes, and many freshwater species will struggle to survive. The very character of the Everglades, its essence as a freshwater wetland ecosystem, is at risk of being irrevocably altered, potentially leading to the displacement of countless species and the loss of a vital natural resource. Restoration projects are underway, aimed at restoring freshwater flow and combatting saltwater intrusion, but time is running out.

## Chapter 2: Glacier National Park: A Farewell to Ice (4:30-8:30)

[VISUAL: Stunning panoramic shots of Glacier National Park's majestic mountains and glaciers. Transition to historical photos showing the glaciers decades ago compared to their current, shrunken state.]

**Narrator:** From the humid wetlands of Florida, we travel north to the rugged peaks of Montana's Glacier National Park. Once home to over 150 glaciers, this iconic park now boasts fewer than 25. And these remaining glaciers are shrinking at an alarming rate.

[VISUAL: Time-lapses showing the rapid retreat of specific glaciers within the park over the past few years. Graphs illustrating the declining glacier ice mass in Glacier National Park.]

**Narrator:** Scientists originally predicted that the glaciers in Glacier National Park would be gone by 2030. While recent studies suggest some may linger slightly longer, the overall trend remains undeniable: these magnificent ice formations are disappearing. This dramatic loss is a direct consequence of rising global temperatures. Warmer temperatures mean less snowfall in the winter and increased melting during the summer, leading to a net loss of ice.

**Narrator:** The disappearance of glaciers has far-reaching consequences for the park's ecosystem. Glacial meltwater feeds the park's rivers and lakes, providing essential water for plants and animals. As the glaciers shrink, water flow becomes less reliable, impacting aquatic habitats and the species that depend on them. Fish populations, including native trout species, are particularly vulnerable.

**Narrator:** The changing climate is also affecting the park's vegetation. Warmer temperatures are allowing tree species to move to higher elevations, displacing alpine meadows and altering the overall landscape. Earlier snowmelt is disrupting the timing of plant flowering, potentially affecting pollinators and other wildlife. The very character of Glacier National Park, defined by its glaciers and alpine ecosystems, is undergoing a profound transformation. In essence, the ecological web is fraying.

**Narrator:** By 2050, Glacier National Park may be largely devoid of glaciers, losing a fundamental aspect of its identity. The landscape will be drier, the rivers less reliable, and the ecosystem significantly altered. While the park will undoubtedly remain beautiful, it will be a very different place, a somber reminder of the impact of climate change.

## Chapter 3: Joshua Tree National Park: A Desert in Distress (8:30-12:30)

[VISUAL: Wide shots of the iconic Joshua Trees scattered across the desert landscape. Heat haze shimmering above the ground.]

**Narrator:** Our final stop takes us to the arid landscapes of Joshua Tree National Park in California. This unique desert ecosystem, famed for its namesake Joshua Trees, is facing a different but equally devastating threat: increased heat and drought.

[VISUAL: Close-ups of drought-stressed Joshua Trees – withered leaves, cracked bark. Graphs showing rising temperatures and declining rainfall in the Mojave Desert.]

**Narrator:** Climate change is causing temperatures to rise and rainfall to decline in the Mojave Desert, pushing Joshua Tree National Park to its limits. Joshua Trees, adapted to the harsh desert environment, are surprisingly sensitive to these changes. They require specific temperature and moisture conditions to thrive, and these conditions are rapidly disappearing.

[VISUAL: Images of dead or dying Joshua Trees. Interviews with researchers studying the impact of climate change on Joshua Tree populations.]

**Narrator:** Studies have shown that Joshua Tree populations are already declining in many parts of the park, particularly at lower elevations. Seedlings are struggling to survive in the drier, hotter conditions, leading to a lack of regeneration. Without new trees to replace the old, the iconic Joshua Tree landscape is slowly disappearing. Furthermore, extended periods of drought put the Joshua Trees under increased stress and make them more susceptible to disease and pests, such as bark beetles.

[VISUAL: Animations showing the projected range shift of Joshua Trees under different climate change scenarios. Maps illustrating the increasing frequency and intensity of wildfires in the Mojave Desert.]

**Narrator:** The future looks bleak for Joshua Tree National Park. Scientists predict that by 2050, large portions of the park may no longer be suitable for Joshua Trees. Their range is expected to shift northward and to higher elevations, but even then, their survival is not guaranteed. Additionally, increased heat and drought are fueling more frequent and intense wildfires, which can devastate Joshua Tree forests.

**Narrator:** What will Joshua Tree National Park look like in 2050? Experts predict a landscape with fewer Joshua Trees, particularly at lower elevations. The desert ecosystem will be more stressed, and the iconic landscape that defines the park will be diminished. The loss of Joshua Trees will also impact the many animals that depend on them for food and shelter, including birds, rodents, and insects. Without serious action, the future of Joshua Tree National Park, as we know it, is deeply uncertain.

## Chapter 4: The Urgency of Action (12:30-14:00)

[VISUAL: Montage of images showing positive actions being taken to combat climate change: renewable energy projects, reforestation efforts, sustainable agriculture.]

**Narrator:** The fate of these three national parks – the Everglades, Glacier, and Joshua Tree – serves as a stark warning about the devastating impacts of climate change. But it's not too late to act. While the challenges are significant, there is still hope.

[VISUAL: Images of people working on conservation projects in the national parks. Close-ups of people planting trees or restoring habitats.]

**Narrator:** We need to drastically reduce our carbon emissions, transition to renewable energy sources, and implement sustainable land management practices. We also need to support conservation efforts in these national parks, such as restoring freshwater flow in the Everglades, protecting vulnerable species in Glacier, and planting drought-resistant trees in Joshua Tree. Individual actions matter too. We can reduce our carbon footprint by making conscious choices about how we travel, what we eat, and how we consume energy.
