This is the unbelievable, against-all-odds story of Giannis Antetokounmpo, the Greek Freak. Buckle up, because this is a journey you won't forget.

**Narrator:** Giannis Antetokounmpo wasn't born into NBA stardom. His parents, Charles and Veronica, were Nigerian immigrants who arrived in Greece seeking a better life. But life in Athens was far from easy. They faced constant discrimination and struggled to find consistent work. Giannis, along with his brothers Thanasis, Kostas, and Alex, had to contribute to the family income from a very young age.

They hawked watches, bags, and sunglasses on the streets. Imagine a future NBA superstar haggling with tourists just to put food on the table. It wasn't glamorous. It was a fight for survival. In interviews, Giannis has often spoken about the constant fear of not knowing where their next meal would come from. They often had to choose between buying food or basketball shoes.

This hardship shaped Giannis. It instilled in him a work ethic, a humility, and a deep appreciation for everything he has achieved. He wasn't just playing basketball; he was playing for his family, for a better future. He was playing to escape poverty. This desperate situation is what fueled his relentless drive, a quality that would later define him on the NBA court. He once stated, "I remember times when we didn't have enough to eat. And that's what motivates me every single day."

## Chapter 2: Discovering Basketball (2:30-4:30)

At the age of 13, Giannis joined the youth ranks of Filathlitikos, a local basketball club in Athens. He was raw, incredibly athletic, but lacked formal training.

But what he lacked in polish, he more than made up for in potential. His combination of size, speed, and agility was simply unheard of. Even at that young age, scouts recognized his unique talent. He started playing for the club's senior team in the Greek Second Division at just 15 years old.
