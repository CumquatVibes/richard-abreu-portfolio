[SCREEN: Show richardabreu.studio scrolled to the "Video Content Pipeline" section]

NARRATOR:
This is the Video Content Pipeline — an internal automation tool built by
Cumquat Vibes Media to manage our network of YouTube channels. I'm Richard
Abreu, the sole owner and operator of this application. Let me walk you
through exactly how it works and what YouTube data it accesses.

---

[CHAPTER 1: What the App Does]

[SCREEN: Show the video-pipeline folder structure in a code editor or terminal]

NARRATOR:
The Video Content Pipeline is a Python-based command-line tool that runs
locally on my machine. It is NOT a web application and is NOT publicly
available. It is used exclusively by me to manage YouTube channels that I
own through the Cumquat Vibes Media brand.

The app handles four main tasks:
1. Script generation for video content
2. Video production with AI-assisted voiceover and visuals
3. Uploading finished videos to the correct YouTube channels
4. Optimizing channel metadata like descriptions, keywords, and playlists

[CHAPTER 2: OAuth Consent Flow]

[SCREEN: Run "python3 setup_channel_auth.py" and show the OAuth flow]

NARRATOR:
Here's how authorization works. When I set up a new channel, I run the
setup script which generates a Google OAuth consent URL. Let me show you.

[SCREEN: Show the consent URL being generated in terminal]

NARRATOR:
The script generates an OAuth URL that I open in my browser. This takes me
to Google's standard consent screen.

[SCREEN: Show Google's OAuth consent screen in browser — highlight the app name
"Video Content Pipeline" and the permissions being requested]

NARRATOR:
As you can see, it clearly shows the app name "Video Content Pipeline" and
requests two specific permissions:
- "Manage your YouTube account" — this allows the app to update channel
  descriptions, keywords, country settings, and create playlists.
- "Manage your YouTube videos" — this allows the app to upload videos with
  titles, descriptions, and tags.

I click "Allow" to grant access. This is the same Google consent screen
every user would see.

[SCREEN: Show the redirect back to localhost with the authorization code]

NARRATOR:
After I authorize, Google redirects back to localhost with an authorization
code. The script exchanges this code for a refresh token, which is stored
locally in a JSON file on my machine. No tokens are sent to any external
server.

[CHAPTER 3: Uploading Videos (youtube.upload scope)]

[SCREEN: Show running "python3 upload_to_youtube.py" in the terminal]

NARRATOR:
Let me demonstrate a video upload. When I run the upload script, it:

1. Reads the video files from the local output directory
2. Matches each video to the correct channel based on the filename prefix
3. Refreshes the OAuth token for that specific channel
4. Uploads the video using YouTube's resumable upload API

[SCREEN: Show the upload in progress — the channel name, title, and status]

NARRATOR:
Each upload includes:
- A title derived from the video filename
- An SEO-optimized description with timestamps and relevant links
- Tags relevant to the video topic
- The correct YouTube category
- An AI content disclosure label — because our videos use AI-generated
  voiceover and visuals, we set "containsSyntheticMedia" to true on every
  upload, as required by YouTube's policies.

[SCREEN: Show a successfully uploaded video in YouTube Studio]

NARRATOR:
Here's the uploaded video in YouTube Studio. You can see the title,
description, tags, and the AI-generated content disclosure are all set
correctly.

[CHAPTER 4: Channel Optimization (youtube scope)]

[SCREEN: Show running "python3 optimize_all_channels.py audit"]

NARRATOR:
Now let me show the channel optimization feature. This is what uses the
"Manage your YouTube account" permission.

When I run an audit, the tool checks each channel's current state:
- Does it have a description?
- Are keywords set?
- Is the country configured for monetization?
- Is the default language set?

[SCREEN: Show the audit output with channel statuses]

NARRATOR:
For channels that need updates, I run the tool in update mode. It sets:
- An SEO-optimized channel description
- Relevant search keywords
- Country set to "US" for monetization eligibility
- Default language set to English
- And creates organized playlists for the channel's content

[SCREEN: Show a channel's updated About page in YouTube Studio]

NARRATOR:
Here's a channel after optimization. The description is filled in with
relevant content, keywords are set, and playlists are organized by topic.

[CHAPTER 5: Data Privacy & Security]

[SCREEN: Show the local file structure — channel_tokens.json, .gitignore]

NARRATOR:
All OAuth tokens are stored locally on my machine in a JSON file. They are
listed in .gitignore and are never committed to version control or sent to
any external service.

[SCREEN: Show the .gitignore entries for sensitive files]

NARRATOR:
The app does not:
- Collect any third-party user data
- Share data with any external service beyond Google's YouTube API
- Store any user data on remote servers
- Allow any user other than the channel owner to authorize

This is a single-user, locally-run tool for managing my own YouTube
channels. No one else has access to it or the tokens it stores.

[CHAPTER 6: Summary]

[SCREEN: Show richardabreu.studio with the Video Content Pipeline section visible]

NARRATOR:
To summarize — the Video Content Pipeline is an internal automation tool
used exclusively by me, Richard Abreu, to manage YouTube channels owned by
Cumquat Vibes Media. It uses the YouTube Data API to:

1. Upload produced videos with proper metadata and AI disclosure labels
2. Optimize channel descriptions, keywords, and settings
3. Create and manage playlists

All data stays local. No third-party data is collected. All usage complies
with the YouTube API Services Terms of Service.

Thank you for reviewing this application.
