## Chapter 1: Keyboard Cat: The AI Remix (0:30-3:30)

**(0:30)**  Alright, kicking off our list at Number 5, we have a classic: Keyboard Cat.  Yeah, the piano-playing feline you thought was relegated to ancient internet history. Think again! **[VISUAL: Original Keyboard Cat video playing.]**

**(0:35)**  So what happened?  Well, thanks to the rise of accessible AI tools, Keyboard Cat has been… remixed.  We're talking AI-generated Keyboard Cat versions playing everything from modern pop hits to classical symphonies. **[VISUAL:  Split screen.  Left side: Original Keyboard Cat. Right Side: AI-generated Keyboard Cat playing a popular song like Billie Eilish's "Bad Guy".]**

**(0:50)**  The resurgence started in late 2024 when a Redditor, u/PianoPurrfection, uploaded an AI-generated cover of Olivia Rodrigo's "Vampire" performed by, you guessed it, Keyboard Cat. The video went viral almost instantly, racking up over 10 million views in the first week.  **[VISUAL: Screenshot of the Reddit post from u/PianoPurrfection with the video embedded, showing view count and upvotes.]**

**(1:05)**  But it didn't stop there.  Other AI enthusiasts jumped on the bandwagon, creating everything from Keyboard Cat doing death metal covers to classical renditions.  The sheer absurdity of it all, combined with the nostalgia factor, has made it a viral sensation all over again.  We’re seeing Keyboard Cat AI covers dominating TikTok challenges and even popping up in Twitch streams as background music. **[VISUAL: TikTok compilation of people using Keyboard Cat AI remixes in their videos, with a variety of challenges/dance trends.]**

**(1:30)** The stats are insane. According to Google Trends, searches for "Keyboard Cat AI" have increased by over 800% in the last six months.  And the best part?  It's sparked a whole new generation of fans who are discovering the original meme for the first time. **[VISUAL: Google Trends graph showing the spike in searches for "Keyboard Cat AI".]**

**(1:45)** There’s even been some academic interest. Dr. Emily Carter, a professor of meme studies at the University of Online, noted that "The Keyboard Cat AI resurgence highlights the cyclical nature of internet culture and the power of AI to breathe new life into even the most seemingly outdated memes."  **[VISUAL: Mock news chyron with Dr. Emily Carter's name and title, superimposed over a photo of a cat wearing glasses.]**

**(2:00)**  One of the key reasons for its success is the accessibility of AI tools.  Now, anyone with a basic understanding of AI software can create their own Keyboard Cat remixes, leading to an explosion of user-generated content.  This participatory element is crucial for keeping the meme alive and evolving.  **[VISUAL:  Screen recording of someone using a simple AI music generation tool, with Keyboard Cat's image integrated.]**

**(2:20)**  We've also seen brands jump on the trend.  Fast food chain "Burger Bliss" released an ad featuring Keyboard Cat AI playing a jingle about their new burger, which, while arguably cringe, further solidified the meme's comeback.  **[VISUAL:  Short clip of the "Burger Bliss" ad featuring Keyboard Cat AI.]**

**(2:35)**  So, Keyboard Cat is back, and it's weirder and more wonderful than ever. It’s a testament to the power of nostalgia and the creative potential of AI.  It really goes to show, you can't keep a good cat down, especially if it knows how to play the piano. **[VISUAL: Montage of various Keyboard Cat AI remixes - different genres, different contexts, ending with the original video.]**

**(3:00)** But it does beg the question - is this a genuine revival, or an AI-fueled zombie meme? Let us know in the comments what you think!
**(3:15)** And, you know, what song would YOU want to see the Keyboard Cat cover?

## Chapter 2: Drakeposting: The Meta-Irony Era (3:30-6:30)

**(3:30)** Coming in hot at Number 4, we have Drakeposting. Remember the meme of Drake either approving or disapproving of certain things? **[VISUAL: Original Drakeposting meme template with a basic example.]**

**(3:40)**  It felt pretty dead in 2023/24. A little too stale. But then something remarkable happened: meta-irony. See, in 2025, it's not enough to *just* use the meme. You have to subvert it, deconstruct it, and layer it with so many levels of irony that it becomes almost incomprehensible. And that's exactly what happened to Drakeposting. **[VISUAL: Drakeposting meme where both choices are equally absurd and nonsensical.  Example: Drake disapproving of "Eating Cereal with a Fork" and approving of "Talking to Plants About Your Taxes".]**

**(4:00)**  The revival began on the obscure forum "4chan-Next," when a user posted a Drakeposting meme where both the "approving" and "disapproving" options were equally terrible, mundane, or just plain bizarre. The post sparked a chain reaction, with other users creating increasingly absurd and layered variations of the meme.  **[VISUAL: Screenshot of the original 4chan-Next post that triggered the Drakeposting resurgence.  Blur out any offensive content.]**

**(4:20)**  These meta-ironic Drakeposting memes often feature esoteric references, absurdist humor, and layers of inside jokes that are only understood by a small subset of internet users.  This exclusivity, ironically, is what made them so appealing. It became a badge of honor to "get" the joke. **[VISUAL:  A compilation of 3-4 extremely meta-ironic Drakeposting memes that are intentionally difficult to understand.]**

**(4:45)**  The trend quickly spread beyond 4chan-Next, infiltrating niche subreddits and Discord servers.  It even made its way to Twitter, where users would post "explanations" of the memes that were often just as confusing and nonsensical as the memes themselves. **[VISUAL:  Tweets that are trying to explain a Drakeposting meme, but they are intentionally convoluted and unhelpful.]**

**(5:00)** This resurgence is a perfect example of how memes evolve and adapt to stay relevant. As internet culture becomes increasingly saturated and self-aware, memes have to push the boundaries of absurdity to stand out.  Meta-irony is the perfect tool for this, allowing creators to poke fun at the meme itself while simultaneously using it to express their own unique perspectives. **[VISUAL: Image showing the evolution of memes from simple formats to complex meta-ironic jokes, using a visual metaphor of a spiral staircase.]**

**(5:20)**  Think of it this way: the original Drakeposting was about simple preferences.  The meta-ironic version is about the inherent meaninglessness of those preferences in the face of existential dread.  Heavy stuff, right?  But that's the internet for you. **[VISUAL:  Drakeposting meme with the "approving" option being "The Illusion of Choice" and the "disapproving" option being "Existential Angst".]**

**(5:40)** Data shows that Drakeposting has seen a 450% increase in usage across meme-sharing platforms compared to the same period last year, according to MemeMetrics. This shows that it's not just a niche trend; it's a full-blown comeback. **[VISUAL:  Graph from MemeMetrics showing the usage spike of Drakeposting.]**

**(6:00)** The meta-ironic Drakeposting phenomenon also highlights the increasing importance of community in meme culture. These memes are often created and shared within closed communities, fostering a sense of belonging and shared identity.  It's like an inside joke that everyone's in on.
**(6:10)** So, is Drakeposting's comeback a sign of the apocalypse, or just a reflection of our increasingly absurd reality? Probably both. **[VISUAL: Drakeposting meme with Drake approving of the apocalypse and disapproving of a normal Tuesday.]**

## Chapter 3: Rage Comics: The Return of the Trollface (6:30-9:30)

**(6:30)** At Number 3, prepare yourselves, because we're going back to the Stone Age of the internet: Rage Comics.  Yes, those crudely drawn faces that defined the early days of meme culture. **[VISUAL: A classic Rage Comic strip featuring Trollface, Me Gusta, and Forever Alone.]**

**(6:45)**  For years, Rage Comics were considered dead and buried, replaced by more sophisticated and nuanced meme formats.  But in 2025, they've staged a surprising comeback, fueled by a potent combination of nostalgia and a backlash against "overly polished" modern memes. **[VISUAL: A "then and now" comparison of memes.  Left side: Rage Comics.  Right side: Highly polished, professionally designed meme.]**

**(7:00)**  The resurgence can be traced back to a viral TikTok trend where users recreated classic Rage Comic scenarios in real life, using makeup and props to mimic the iconic faces.  The hashtag #RageComicRevival quickly gained traction, racking up millions of views. **[VISUAL: Compilation of TikTok videos where users are recreating Rage Comic characters with makeup and props.]**

**(7:20)**  This TikTok trend sparked a wave of nostalgia, with users revisiting old Rage Comic archives and sharing their favorite strips.  It also led to a renewed appreciation for the simplicity and relatability of the original Rage Comics.  **[VISUAL: Screen recording of someone scrolling through a Rage Comic archive website.]**

**(7:40)**  But the comeback isn't just about nostalgia.  Many users are also embracing Rage Comics as a form of protest against the increasingly commercialized and sanitized nature of modern meme culture.  Rage Comics, with their raw and unfiltered humor, offer a refreshing alternative to the polished and brand-friendly memes that dominate social media. **[VISUAL: A Rage Comic strip satirizing corporate attempts to create viral memes.]**

**(8:00)**  Furthermore, there's a certain charm in their simplicity. The intentional lack of polish resonates with some viewers who find modern memes overly calculated. It is a sort of return to "real".

**(8:10)**  The data supports this trend.  According to KnowYourMeme analytics, searches for "Rage Comics" and specific characters like "Trollface" and "Me Gusta" have increased by over 600% in the past year.  And online stores are even selling Rage Comic merchandise, from t-shirts to plushies. **[VISUAL: Graph from KnowYourMeme showing the search interest increase.

**(8:30)**  We’ve also seen artists experimenting with Rage Comics, combining them with modern meme formats and art styles.  This fusion of old and new is helping to keep the trend fresh and relevant. **[VISUAL: Examples of Rage Comics being combined with modern memes, like Drakeposting or Wojak comics.]**

**(8:50)** Of course, not everyone is happy about the return of Rage Comics. Some argue that they're outdated and cringeworthy, and that they should stay buried in the past. But the internet is a democracy, and the people have spoken: Rage Comics are back, baby! **[VISUAL: A split screen showing one person reacting positively to Rage Comics, and another person reacting negatively.]**

**(9:10)** The return of Rage Comics speaks to our collective longing for simpler times. A time when all you needed was a poorly drawn face and a relatable situation to make someone laugh. Let us know in the comments which Rage comic you miss the most!
**(9:20)** Bonus points if you still remember the backstory of the "Forever Alone" guy!

## Chapter 4: Wojak: The Existential Crisis Continues (9:30-12:30)

**(9:30)**  Sliding into the Number 2 spot, we have Wojak. This one might not seem like a *comeback* per se, since Wojak never really went away. But in 2025, Wojak has evolved into something… different. Something deeper.  Something… more existential. **[VISUAL: A compilation of various Wojak variations - classic Soyjak, Chad, Doomer, etc.]**

**(9:45)**  While Wojak has always been used to express a range of emotions and perspectives, in 2025, he's become the go-to meme for exploring the complexities of modern life, from the anxieties of social media to the search for meaning in a meaningless world. **[VISUAL: A Wojak meme depicting the feeling of being overwhelmed by social media.  Example: Wojak surrounded by endless scrolling feeds.]**

**(10:00)** The evolution of Wojak can be attributed to several factors. First, the increasing awareness of mental health issues has made people more open to discussing their struggles online. Wojak, with his simple yet expressive face, provides a safe and relatable way to communicate these feelings. **[VISUAL: A Wojak meme about the importance of seeking mental health support.]**

**(10:20)** Second, the rise of "doomer" culture has further amplified Wojak's role as a symbol of existential dread. Doomers, who often feel disillusioned and hopeless about the future, have embraced Wojak as their mascot.  **[VISUAL: A Wojak meme depicting a "doomer" contemplating the end of the world.]**

**(10:40)** But the Wojak resurgence isn't just about negativity. It's also about finding humor and connection in shared experiences. Many Wojak memes are self-deprecating and relatable, allowing users to laugh at their own flaws and struggles. **[VISUAL: A Wojak meme that is self-deprecating and relatable, poking fun at common anxieties.]**

**(11:00)** And the artistic creativity has exploded! We're seeing incredibly detailed Wojak art, Wojak animations, and even Wojak-inspired music. The character has transcended its simple origins and become a blank canvas for artistic expression. **[VISUAL: A montage of highly detailed Wojak art, animations, and a clip of a song inspired by Wojak.]**

**(11:20)** Data from MemePulse shows that Wojak-related content has seen a 300% increase in engagement compared to last year. And the average sentiment score of Wojak memes has actually increased, suggesting that people are using them to express a wider range of emotions, not just sadness and despair. **[VISUAL: Graph from MemePulse showing the engagement increase and sentiment score trend.]**

**(11:40)** One notable trend is the rise of "Copejak," a variation of Wojak that represents the coping mechanisms people use to deal with their anxieties and insecurities. This meme highlights the human desire to find meaning and happiness, even in the face of adversity. **[VISUAL: Examples of "Copejak" memes, depicting different coping mechanisms like exercise, meditation, or hobbies.]**

**(12:00)** Wojak has become a mirror reflecting our collective anxieties and aspirations. It's a meme that reminds us that we're not alone in our struggles, and that even in the darkest of times, there's always room for humor and connection.
**(12:10)** Are you a Wojak enjoyer? What's your favorite flavor of Wojak meme? Let us know.

## Chapter 5: Loss.jpg: The Unkillable Comic (12:30-15:30)

**(12:30)** Finally, at Number 1, the ultimate meme comeback of 2025 is… Loss.jpg. Yes, the four-panel comic about miscarriage that has somehow managed to remain relevant for over a decade. **[VISUAL: The original Loss.jpg comic.]**

**(12:45)** Loss.jpg is a meme that refuses to die. It has been parodied, deconstructed, and reinterpreted in countless ways. And yet, it continues to resurface, reminding us of its enduring power and its ability to provoke a wide range of emotions. **[VISUAL: A compilation of various Loss.jpg parodies and reinterpretations.]**

**(13:00)** The reason for Loss.jpg's longevity is complex. On one hand, it's a testament to the internet's ability to remember and recycle content. Once a meme enters the collective consciousness, it's almost impossible to erase it completely. **[VISUAL: A visual metaphor of the internet as a vast library, with Loss.jpg being a book that keeps getting checked out.]**

**(13:20)** On the other hand, Loss.
