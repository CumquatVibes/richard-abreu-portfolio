**NARRATOR:** First, we're slowing down the tempo to around 70 BPM and smoothing out the aggressive beat. Then, we swapped the minor key for a more uplifting major key, like C Major or G Major and added a pop-friendly chord progression, maybe something like I-V-vi-IV. Finally, layering on piano, strings, and reverb-drenched vocals.
