## 1. Window Tinting (0:30-2:00)
[VOICEOVER]
First up, and arguably one of the most impactful mods you can make: window tinting. Not only does it instantly give your car a sleek, more aggressive look, but it also offers practical benefits. We're talking reduced glare, cooler interior temperatures, and increased privacy.

[VOICEOVER]
Professionally installed tint will cost you between $150 and $300 depending on the size of your car and the type of film you choose. Don't skimp on quality here! Look for ceramic tint. It may cost a bit more upfront but offers superior heat rejection compared to dyed films. This will keep your car cooler in the summer and reduce the need to blast the AC, saving you gas. Plus, it blocks up to 99% of harmful UV rays, protecting your interior from fading. Important legal note: always check your local tint laws to ensure you're within compliance. Nobody wants a ticket!

[VOICEOVER]
If you're feeling ambitious, you can try a DIY tint kit for around $50-$100, but be warned, it takes patience and skill to get a professional-looking result. Bubbles and creases are your enemies! Watch some tutorial videos before attempting this. Honestly, for the peace of mind and quality, professional installation is the way to go.

## 2. Upgraded Interior Lighting (2:00-3:30)
[VOICEOVER]
Next, let's brighten up the interior. Swapping out those dull, yellowish factory bulbs for LED replacements is a quick, easy, and affordable upgrade that can drastically improve the look and feel of your cabin.

[VOICEOVER]
A full LED interior kit, including map lights, dome lights, and even license plate lights, will typically run you between $20 and $50. Look for kits that are specifically designed for your car model for a perfect fit. LED bulbs are not only brighter and more energy-efficient, but they also last significantly longer than traditional halogen bulbs. Some kits also offer different color options, letting you customize the look to your liking.

[VOICEOVER]
For an extra touch of ambiance, consider adding LED strip lighting under the seats or along the dashboard. These are readily available online and can be controlled with a remote or even through your smartphone. Just be mindful not to choose overly bright or distracting colors that could impair your driving. Remember, safety first!

## 3. Performance Air Filter (3:30-5:00)
[VOICEOVER]
Alright, let's talk performance! While a full-blown engine tune might be out of our budget, a high-flow performance air filter is a simple and cost-effective way to improve your engine's breathing and potentially increase horsepower and fuel economy.

[VOICEOVER]
These filters, like those from K&N or AEM, are designed to allow more air to flow into the engine, leading to improved throttle response and a slight bump in power. Don't expect a massive increase, but you should notice a difference, especially at higher RPMs. The best part? They're reusable! Simply wash and re-oil them every 25,000 to 50,000 miles, saving you money on replacement filters in the long run. Expect to spend between $50 and $100 for a quality performance air filter. Make sure to get one that fits your specific car model.

Installation is usually a breeze. Most air filters are located in an easily accessible box under the hood. Just pop it open, swap the old filter for the new one, and you're good to go! Check your owner's manual for specific instructions.

## 4. Upgraded Shift Knob & Steering Wheel Cover (5:00-6:30)
[VOICEOVER]
Let's move back inside and focus on the driver's touchpoints. Replacing your shift knob and adding a steering wheel cover can dramatically improve the feel and look of your driving experience without costing a fortune.

[VOICEOVER]
A new shift knob can add a touch of sportiness or luxury to your interior. You can find aftermarket options in various materials like aluminum, leather, or even carbon fiber, ranging from $30 to $80. Installation is usually straightforward, involving unscrewing the old knob and screwing on the new one. Just make sure the threads are compatible with your car's shifter.

[VOICEOVER]
Similarly, a steering wheel cover can improve grip and comfort while protecting your steering wheel from wear and tear. A high-quality leather or suede cover can add a premium feel to your cabin. Expect to spend between $20 and $50 for a decent cover. Make sure to choose a cover that fits snugly and securely on your steering wheel to avoid any slippage while driving.

## 5. Detailing & Paint Correction (6:30-8:00)
[VOICEOVER]
You might be surprised to hear this, but one of the best ways to transform your car is simply to give it a thorough detailing! A clean and well-maintained car always looks better, no matter its age or model.

[VOICEOVER]
Investing in a good quality car wash soap, clay bar, polish, and wax can make a huge difference. You can get a detailing kit for under $100 that includes everything you need to get started. Clay barring removes embedded contaminants from your paint, polishing removes swirl marks and scratches, and waxing protects your paint and adds a glossy shine.

[VOICEOVER]
This is where elbow grease comes in! While a professional detailing job can cost hundreds of dollars, you can achieve similar results yourself with some patience and effort. There are tons of tutorials online that can guide you through the process. And don't forget the interior! Vacuuming, cleaning the upholstery, and wiping down the dashboard can also make a huge difference in the overall look and feel of your car.

## 6. Aftermarket Floor Mats (8:00-9:30)
[VOICEOVER]
Our last budget-friendly upgrade is a set of aftermarket floor mats. Those old, worn-out mats can really detract from the overall appearance of your interior.

[VOICEOVER]
A set of high-quality floor mats, like those from WeatherTech or Husky Liners, can not only protect your carpets from dirt and spills, but also add a touch of style to your cabin. Look for custom-fit mats that are designed specifically for your car model for a perfect fit and maximum protection. These mats are typically made from durable materials like rubber or thermoplastic and are designed to withstand heavy use.

[VOICEOVER]
You can find a decent set of aftermarket floor mats for between $50 and $150, depending on the brand and material. This small investment can go a long way in improving the overall look and feel of your car's interior, especially if you live in an area with harsh weather conditions.
