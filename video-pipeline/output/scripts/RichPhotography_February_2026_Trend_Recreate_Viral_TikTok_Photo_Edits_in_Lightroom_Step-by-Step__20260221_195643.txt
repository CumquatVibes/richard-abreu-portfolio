## Hook (0:00-0:30)

Did you know that photos edited with a specific teal and orange, hyper-realistic aesthetic got 3 BILLION views on TikTok last month? That's more than the entire population of the planet! [VISUAL: Montage of trending TikTok photos with the aforementioned editing style, overlaid with text: "3 BILLION views in January 2026!"] Today, we're cracking the code on this viral photo editing trend. I'm going to show you, step-by-step, how to recreate these stunning looks in Lightroom, even if you're a complete beginner. [VISUAL: Quick cuts of the speaker's hands working within Lightroom, showcasing sliders being adjusted] This isn't just about following a trend; it's about understanding the techniques behind the style and applying them to your own unique vision.

## Chapter 1: Understanding the TikTok Trend (0:30-1:30)

Okay, so what exactly *is* this viral TikTok photo editing style? [VISUAL: Screen recording of scrolling through TikTok, highlighting videos that use the specified editing style, with text overlay indicating view counts.] It’s characterized by a few key elements: Firstly, strong teal and orange color grading – emphasizing warm skin tones and cool, desaturated backgrounds. We're talking almost a cyberpunk-ish feel. [VISUAL: Close-up shots highlighting teal and orange color grading on different photos.] Secondly, heightened sharpness and clarity, almost to the point of hyper-realism. Think of it as HDR without the overly processed look. [VISUAL: Zooming in on a portion of a photo, showcasing the enhanced sharpness and clarity.] And finally, often a subtle vignette to draw the viewer's eye to the center of the image. [VISUAL: Before-and-after comparison of a photo with and without a vignette effect, highlighting the difference.] The reason this style is so popular is that it makes images instantly eye-catching and visually appealing, perfect for short-form video content where you only have a few seconds to grab someone's attention. Data from Visual Trends Report 2025 even stated that "bold color palettes and enhanced detail capture immediate audience attention." We're going to learn how to leverage that attention!

## Chapter 2: Setting Up Lightroom (1:30-2:30)

Alright, let's jump into Lightroom. [VISUAL: Screen recording of opening Adobe Lightroom Classic and navigating to the Library module.] I'll be using Lightroom Classic for this tutorial, but you can achieve similar results with Lightroom Mobile, though the interface will be slightly different. [VISUAL: Quick comparison shots of Lightroom Classic and Lightroom Mobile interfaces, highlighting key differences.] First things first, import the image you want to edit. I recommend choosing a photo with good lighting and a clear subject. [VISUAL: Screen recording of importing a sample image into Lightroom.] For this tutorial, I'm using a portrait taken during golden hour. [VISUAL: The sample image, a portrait taken during golden hour, displayed in Lightroom.] It already has a warm light source, which will complement the teal and orange color palette perfectly. Before we start editing, make sure you're working with a RAW file. [VISUAL: Example of RAW file format (.CR2, .NEF, .ARW) displayed alongside a JPEG file.] RAW files contain more information than JPEGs, giving you greater flexibility in post-processing.

## Chapter 3: Basic Adjustments: Exposure & Contrast (2:30-4:00)

We'll begin with the Basic panel. [VISUAL: Screen recording of navigating to the "Basic" panel in Lightroom's Develop module.] The first thing we want to do is adjust the Exposure. [VISUAL: Sliding the "Exposure" slider in Lightroom, showing the image brightening and darkening.] For my image, I'm going to slightly increase the exposure by about +0.3 to brighten up the shadows. Next, let's play with the Contrast. [VISUAL: Sliding the "Contrast" slider in Lightroom, showing the image becoming more and less contrasty.] I'm going to increase the contrast just a touch, around +10, to give the image a bit more punch. Now, let's tackle the Highlights and Shadows. [VISUAL: Sliding the "Highlights" slider in Lightroom, showing the highlights becoming brighter and darker.] I want to bring down the highlights a bit to recover some detail in the sky, so I'll decrease the Highlights to around -20. [VISUAL: Sliding the "Shadows" slider in Lightroom, showing the shadows becoming brighter and darker.] Then, I'll lift the Shadows to brighten up the darker areas of the portrait by about +15. Finally, let's adjust the Whites and Blacks. [VISUAL: Sliding the "Whites" slider in Lightroom, showing the white areas becoming brighter and darker.] I'll increase the Whites slightly to add more pop to the brighter areas, around +5. [VISUAL: Sliding the "Blacks" slider in Lightroom, showing the black areas becoming darker and lighter.] And I'll decrease the Blacks a touch to add more depth to the shadows, around -10. These initial adjustments provide a strong foundation for the color grading we’ll do next.

## Chapter 4: Mastering Color Grading: Teal & Orange (4:00-6:00)

This is where the magic happens! We’re going to use the Color Grading panel to achieve that signature teal and orange look. [VISUAL: Screen recording of navigating to the "Color Grading" panel in Lightroom.] This panel allows you to adjust the colors in the shadows, midtones, and highlights separately. Let's start with the Shadows. [VISUAL: Adjusting the "Hue" and "Saturation" sliders in the "Shadows" section of the Color Grading panel, adding teal tones.] I'm going to add a cool, teal tint to the shadows by setting the Hue to around 190 and the Saturation to around 15. This will give the darker areas of the image a cool, desaturated look. Now, let's move on to the Highlights. [VISUAL: Adjusting the "Hue" and "Saturation" sliders in the "Highlights" section of the Color Grading panel, adding orange tones.] I'm going to add a warm, orange tint to the highlights by setting the Hue to around 35 and the Saturation to around 10. This will complement the skin tones and create a pleasing contrast with the teal shadows. For the Midtones, [VISUAL: Adjusting the "Hue" and "Saturation" sliders in the "Midtones" section of the Color Grading panel, adding a subtle orange tint.] I'm going to add a subtle orange tint, similar to the highlights, but with a slightly lower saturation. I'll set the Hue to around 30 and the Saturation to around 5. Finally, let's adjust the Blending and Balance. [VISUAL: Adjusting the "Blending" slider in the Color Grading panel, showing the transition between shadow, midtone, and highlight colors.] Increasing the Blending will create a smoother transition between the colors, while adjusting the Balance will shift the overall color balance towards the shadows or highlights. I’ll set the Blending to around 60 and the Balance to around +10 to favor the highlights slightly.

## Chapter 5: Detail Enhancement: Clarity & Sharpening (6:00-7:30)

Now, let's enhance the details and sharpness of the image. [VISUAL: Screen recording of navigating to the "Detail" panel in Lightroom.] We'll start with Clarity. [VISUAL: Sliding the "Clarity" slider in Lightroom, showing the image becoming more and less defined.] I'm going to increase the Clarity quite a bit, around +40, to give the image a more defined and hyper-realistic look. This adds contrast to the midtones, making the details pop. Next, let's move on to Sharpening. [VISUAL: Adjusting the "Amount," "Radius," and "Detail" sliders in the "Sharpening" section of the Detail panel.] I'll increase the Amount to around 60, the Radius to around 1.0, and the Detail to around 50. These settings will sharpen the image without creating unwanted artifacts. It’s important to use the Masking slider to prevent sharpening on areas like the sky or smooth skin. [VISUAL: Adjusting the "Masking" slider in the "Sharpening" section of the Detail panel, showing the sharpening effect being applied to specific areas of the image.] Hold the Alt/Option key while adjusting the Masking slider to visualize the masked areas. I'll set the Masking to around 50 to protect the smoother areas of the image. Reducing noise is also important if you are sharpening your photo too much. [VISUAL: Adjusting the "Luminance" slider in the "Noise Reduction" section of the Detail panel]

## Chapter 6: Vignette & Final Touches (7:30-9:00)

To complete the look, let's add a subtle vignette and make any final adjustments. [VISUAL: Screen recording of navigating to the "Effects" panel in Lightroom.] In the Effects panel, you'll find the Vignette settings. [VISUAL: Adjusting the "Amount" slider in the "Vignette" section of the Effects panel, adding a dark vignette.] I'm going to add a subtle dark vignette by setting the Amount to around -15. This will draw the viewer's eye to the center of the image, emphasizing the subject. [VISUAL: Adjusting the "Midpoint," "Roundness," and "Feather" sliders in the "Vignette" section of the Effects panel, fine-tuning the vignette effect.] I'll also adjust the Midpoint, Roundness, and Feather to fine-tune the vignette effect. A higher Feather will create a softer, more gradual transition. I would also recommend using radial filters to adjust areas that the light is affecting unevenly. [VISUAL: adding a radial filter over a face to brighten it without effecting the rest of the frame] Now, take a step back and look at the overall image. [VISUAL: Full screen view of the edited image.] Are there any areas that need further adjustment? Maybe the skin tones are too orange, or the shadows are too teal? Use the HSL panel to fine-tune the colors if needed. [VISUAL: Screen recording of navigating to the "HSL" panel and adjusting individual color sliders.] Remember, the key to successful photo editing is to experiment and find what works best for your own style and vision.

## Chapter 7: Exporting Your Image (9:00-10:00)

Now that you've edited your image, it's time to export it. [VISUAL: Screen recording of navigating to "File" > "Export" in Lightroom.] Go to File > Export and choose your desired export settings. For sharing on social media, I recommend exporting as a JPEG with a quality of 80%. [VISUAL: Export settings window in Lightroom, highlighting the JPEG format and quality setting.] If you're printing the image, you'll want to export as a TIFF or high-quality JPEG. It's crucial to resize the image appropriately for the platform you're using. [VISUAL: Export settings window in Lightroom, highlighting the image sizing options.] TikTok recommends a resolution of 1080 x 1920 pixels. Choose a file name and location, and then click Export. [VISUAL: Clicking the "Export" button in the export settings window.] Congratulations, you've successfully recreated the viral TikTok photo editing style in Lightroom!

## Chapter 8: Lightroom Mobile Quick Edit (10:00-11:30)

Let's quickly see how to achieve a similar effect in Lightroom Mobile. [VISUAL: Screen recording of using Lightroom Mobile on a phone.] Open your image in the app. [VISUAL: Sample portrait in Lightroom Mobile interface] Go to the Color section and adjust the Mix sliders to achieve the teal and orange tones. [VISUAL: Adjusting the Mix sliders in Lightroom Mobile] Then in the Effects section, boost Clarity and add a vignette. [VISUAL: Adjusting Clarity and Vignette sliders in Lightroom Mobile] You can also use Selective adjustments for more precision. [VISUAL: Using a Selective adjustment to brighten the face] This allows for on-the-go editing with similar control. [VISUAL: Before and after split screen in Lightroom Mobile]

So, to recap, we covered the key elements of the viral TikTok photo editing trend: teal and orange color grading, heightened sharpness and clarity, and a subtle vignette. [VISUAL: Montage of the key steps in the tutorial, highlighting each element.] We learned how to achieve these effects in Lightroom using the Basic, Color Grading, and Detail panels. Remember that the specific settings will vary depending on the image, so don't be afraid to experiment and find what works best for you. The goal isn't to just copy this style, but to understand the techniques behind it and apply them to your own unique creative vision.
