So there you have it – the top 7 cat breeds that act like dogs! These feline friends are sure to bring joy and companionship to any home.

Before you rush out to adopt one of these dog-like cats, remember that every cat is an individual. Breed characteristics are general guidelines. And it's important to consider their individual personality and needs.

[VISUAL: Screen with text: "CONSIDER ADOPTION!"]

Consider adopting a cat from your local shelter or rescue organization. You might just find your own dog-like feline friend waiting for you there!

And number one might surprise you: training works differently. Cats respond best to positive reinforcement. Use treats, praise, and clicker training methods. Be patient and consistent. Short, frequent sessions work better than long ones. Never punish a cat for not understanding a command. This damages your bond.
