This isn't just a shopping district; it's a gastronomic playground where culinary innovation meets traditional Korean flavors. Nestled in the heart of Seoul, Myeongdong is estimated to generate over $300 million annually from street food alone! That's right, folks, we're talking big business and even bigger flavors.

## Chapter 2: The Spicy Staple: Tteokbokki (1:30-3:00)

[VISUAL: Close-up of tteokbokki being cooked in a large pan, showing the vibrant red sauce and chewy rice cakes]

**Narrator:** First up, we’re hitting the spicy stuff! No Myeongdong street food adventure is complete without a generous serving of Tteokbokki. These chewy rice cakes, simmered in a gochujang-based sauce, are a true Korean staple. But forget your average tteokbokki; here, they take it to another level.

[VISUAL: Shot of different variations of tteokbokki – with cheese, ramen noodles, and even seafood]

**Narrator:** We tried a few different versions. One had a mountain of melted mozzarella, creating a gooey, cheesy masterpiece that perfectly balanced the spice. Another came with a generous helping of ramen noodles, transforming it into a hearty and satisfying meal. We even saw one with shrimp and squid. The spice level varies from vendor to vendor, so be sure to ask if you're sensitive to heat! Gochujang, the fermented chili paste that gives tteokbokki its signature kick, has been a cornerstone of Korean cuisine for centuries. It is thought to have been introduced by the Japanese in the 16th century, but it really took off with the invention of the gochujang production process in the early 1800s.

[VISUAL: Shot of different toppings being added to gyeranppang – cheese, ham, parsley, and even sweet chili sauce]

The combination of the slightly sweet bread, the savory egg, and the various toppings is pure genius. Apparently, Gyeranppang first became popular in the 1980s as a quick and affordable breakfast snack. Now, it's a beloved street food staple enjoyed by locals and tourists alike.
