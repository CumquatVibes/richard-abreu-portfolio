## Chapter 1: Trip World (0:30-1:45)

Trip World is a beautiful, albeit short, platformer developed by Sunsoft, the same company that gave us Batman for the NES! Released late in the Game Boy's lifespan in 1992, and only in Japan and Europe, it's a rarity that many gamers missed. You play as Yakopoo, a cute, rabbit-like creature whose peaceful world is threatened.

What makes Trip World so special is its innovative gameplay and charming visuals. Yakopoo can transform into different forms, changing his abilities to navigate the levels. He can turn into a flying form, a swimming form, and even a stone statue! The game also features some incredibly smooth animations and detailed backgrounds for a Game Boy title. With only 5000 copies ever being released in Europe, its rarity is a major contributing factor to it being overlooked. Don't let the cutesy exterior fool you - Trip World is a fantastic platformer that deserves a spot in every retro gamer's collection.

Possess enemies and use their unique abilities to fight your way through hordes of bad guys! That's the premise of Avenging Spirit, a unique and challenging arcade-style platformer. Originally an arcade game, Avenging Spirit was adapted to the Game Boy in 1993.

Prepare for some serious retro weirdness! Heian Alien is a bizarre and unique action-puzzle game set in ancient Japan, where you control a detective whose job is to capture aliens disguised as townsfolk.

The gameplay involves walking around town and cornering disguised aliens by surrounding them with fences. Once trapped, the aliens revert to their true form, and you can capture them.

The game's unique setting and quirky gameplay make it a truly memorable experience. It's an obscure title that's worth checking out for its originality and charm. You can use the money you earn from defeating aliens to buy better items.
