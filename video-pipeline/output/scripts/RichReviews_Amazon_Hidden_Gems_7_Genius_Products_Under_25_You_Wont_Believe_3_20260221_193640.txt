Just crack the egg into the separator, and the yolk stays put while the white drips through. Perfect for baking, cooking, or anyone who wants to avoid yolk contamination. This is also amazing for anyone following a low-carb diet, as you can easily use the egg whites to make meringues or other treats.

They're far superior to paper towels for streak-free cleaning, and they're reusable and washable, making them an eco-friendly choice. According to a study published in the "Journal of Applied Microbiology," microfiber cloths can remove up to 99% of bacteria from surfaces, compared to the 30% removal rate of cotton cloths. These are a cleaning essential for any household.

## Chapter 7: Reusable Grocery Bags (8:15-9:30)

Let's end on a practical and eco-friendly note with Reusable Grocery Bags! Okay, these aren't exactly 'hidden' but the QUALITY and convenience of some reusable bags are worth highlighting. These bags are not only much stronger and more durable than plastic bags, but they also fold up super small for easy storage. Look for ones that are rip resistant and machine washable. Many cities and states are now charging fees for single-use plastic bags. Investing in a good set of reusable bags will save you money in the long run and help reduce plastic waste. According to the United Nations Environment Programme, approximately 5 trillion plastic bags are used worldwide each year! Let's do our part to reduce that number.
