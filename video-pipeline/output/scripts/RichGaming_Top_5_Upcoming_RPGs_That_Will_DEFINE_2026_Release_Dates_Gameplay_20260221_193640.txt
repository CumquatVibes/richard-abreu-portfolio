First up is a game shrouded in mystery, but the whispers alone are enough to send chills down your spine. I’m talking about Project Awakening. Developed by Cygames, the studio behind the wildly popular Granblue Fantasy, this game has been teased for years, and 2026 is looking like the year it *finally* arrives.

Project Awakening promises a seamless open world, unlike anything we've seen before. Forget loading screens between zones. We're talking a truly persistent and dynamic world reacting to your every action. What sets it apart is the sheer scale of its environments. The world feels truly lived in, with detailed ecosystems and breathtaking vistas.

The combat is rumored to be a brutal dance of precision and timing, borrowing elements from games like Monster Hunter, but with a distinctly Japanese flair. We've seen glimpses of gigantic monsters requiring strategic team efforts to take down. The level of detail in the monster design is truly astonishing. They are horrifying, beautiful, and incredibly challenging to fight.

While details are still scarce, Cygames has confirmed a deep and intricate story centered around themes of destiny, sacrifice, and the struggle for survival in a world teetering on the brink of collapse. We can anticipate a complex narrative with multiple branching paths and morally grey choices.

Release is anticipated for late 2026 for PC and next-gen consoles. Keep your eyes peeled, RichGamers, because Project Awakening has the potential to be a true game-changer.

## 2. Avowed (2:00-3:30)

Next on our list is Avowed, the highly anticipated RPG from Obsidian Entertainment, the masters of choice-driven narratives. Set in the world of Eora, the same universe as Pillars of Eternity, Avowed promises a first-person RPG experience steeped in lore and brimming with difficult decisions.

This isn’t just another fantasy RPG. Eora is a world filled with complex factions, ancient secrets, and powerful magic. You'll be playing as an envoy sent to investigate a mysterious plague that threatens to consume the Living Lands. But you quickly find yourself embroiled in a conflict that could reshape the entire world.

Gameplay wise, Avowed takes a page from the Elder Scrolls playbook, offering a mix of melee combat, ranged weapons, and powerful spells. However, Obsidian is known for their deep RPG systems, expect a level of customization and player agency rarely seen in first-person titles.

The narrative is where Avowed will truly shine. Prepare to make tough choices that will have significant consequences for the world and the characters around you. Expect compelling companions with their own motivations and backstories, each reacting to your actions in unique ways. Your choices will determine the fate of Eora.

Avowed is scheduled for a release in early 2026 for PC and Xbox Series X/S. If you're a fan of morally ambiguous choices, immersive world-building, and deep RPG mechanics, Avowed should be at the top of your list.

## 3. Dragon Age: Dreadwolf (3:30-5:00)

Coming in at number three, we have a game that has been a long time coming, Dragon Age: Dreadwolf. After the mixed reception of Inquisition, BioWare is determined to deliver a Dragon Age experience that will reignite the passion of long-time fans and bring in a new generation of players.

While official gameplay footage is still under wraps, BioWare has been steadily releasing snippets of information, hinting at a darker, more mature story centered around the enigmatic Solas, the Dread Wolf. He's not just a villain; he's a complex and deeply flawed character with his own agenda.

Set in the land of Tevinter, a magocracy ruled by powerful mages, Dreadwolf promises a rich and diverse world filled with political intrigue, ancient secrets, and terrifying threats. We can expect to explore bustling cities, treacherous swamps, and forgotten ruins.

While the combat system is still a mystery, we can assume that BioWare will build upon the foundation of previous Dragon Age games, offering a mix of tactical combat and real-time action. Expect a customizable party of companions with unique abilities and backstories, each playing a crucial role in the story.

Dragon Age: Dreadwolf is slated for a release in late 2026 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S. Get ready to delve into the dark and dangerous world of Tevinter, where your choices will determine the fate of Thedas.

## 4. Kingdom Come: Deliverance II (5:00-6:30)

At number four, we have a sequel that many thought would never happen, but the medieval gods have answered our prayers! It’s Kingdom Come: Deliverance II. Warhorse Studios is back to deliver another dose of brutally realistic medieval RPG action.

Set in 15th century Bohemia, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II promises an even more immersive and authentic experience than its predecessor. You'll once again step into the boots of Henry, a peasant boy caught in the chaos of a civil war.

Forget fantastical creatures and magical powers. Kingdom Come: Deliverance II focuses on grounded realism. Combat is brutal and unforgiving, requiring skill and precision. You'll need to master sword fighting, archery, and even alchemy to survive.

The world is incredibly detailed, with historically accurate towns, villages, and landscapes. NPC interactions feel authentic, with each character having their own routines and motivations. Your choices will have real consequences, shaping the world around you.

Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is scheduled for release in mid-2026 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S. Prepare to be transported back to medieval Bohemia, where your actions will determine the fate of a kingdom.

## 5. Clockwork Revolution (6:30-8:00)

And finally, at number five, we have an intriguing new IP from inXile Entertainment, the studio behind Wasteland 3. Get ready to bend time and rewrite history in Clockwork Revolution.

Set in the steampunk city of Avalon, Clockwork Revolution offers a unique twist on the RPG formula. You'll discover a device that allows you to travel back in time and alter past events. But be warned, every action has consequences, and changing the past can have unforeseen effects on the present.

Avalon is a beautifully crafted city powered by intricate clockwork mechanisms. Explore its bustling streets, uncover its hidden secrets, and interact with its diverse cast of characters.

The combat system is rumored to be a fast-paced mix of gunplay and steampunk gadgets. Expect to use your time manipulation abilities to gain an edge in battle, slowing down time, rewinding mistakes, and altering the environment to your advantage.
