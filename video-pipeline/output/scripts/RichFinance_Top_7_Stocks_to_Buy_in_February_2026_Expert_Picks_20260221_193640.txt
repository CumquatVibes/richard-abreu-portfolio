Before we dive into the specific stocks, let's paint a picture of the financial landscape we anticipate in early 2026.

Inflation, while hopefully stabilized, will still be a factor, meaning companies with strong pricing power will be key. Interest rates, while potentially lower than today, will still influence investment decisions. And geopolitical factors, as always, will introduce an element of uncertainty. Therefore, we're looking for resilient businesses with strong fundamentals, capable management, and a clear path to profitability. This isn’t financial advice, of course, just our well-researched opinion. Always do your own due diligence.
