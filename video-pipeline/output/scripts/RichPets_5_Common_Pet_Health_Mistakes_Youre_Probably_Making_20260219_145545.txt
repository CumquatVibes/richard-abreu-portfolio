[MISTAKE #1: Ignoring Dental Health]

Narrator: First up, we have dental health. It's easy to overlook, but neglecting your pet’s teeth can lead to serious problems.

Narrator: Studies show that over 80% of dogs and 70% of cats show signs of oral disease by the age of three. This isn't just bad breath; it's a gateway to kidney, liver, and heart problems.

Narrator: The fix? Regular brushing. Ideally, you should brush your pet’s teeth daily, but even a few times a week can make a huge difference.

Narrator: Use a pet-specific toothpaste - human toothpaste is toxic to animals. And if brushing is a battle, talk to your vet about dental chews, specialized food, or professional cleaning options. But here's where it gets interesting: certain breeds are more prone to dental issues. For example, smaller breeds of dogs, like Yorkshire Terriers and Chihuahuas, are notorious for developing tartar buildup quickly due to their smaller mouths and crowded teeth.

[MISTAKE #2: Overfeeding and Lack of Exercise]

Narrator: Next on our list is a pretty big one: overfeeding and lack of exercise. Sadly, pet obesity is on the rise.

Narrator: An overweight pet is at risk for diabetes, arthritis, heart disease, and a shorter lifespan. It really boils down to calories in versus calories out.

Narrator: Measure your pet's food carefully using a measuring cup. Ditch the free-feeding! And talk to your vet about the appropriate portion size for your pet's breed, age, and activity level. Don’t forget to factor in treats!

Narrator: Get your pet moving! Daily walks, playtime, or even interactive toys can make a huge difference. Even cats benefit from regular play sessions.

[MISTAKE #3: Skipping Regular Vet Checkups]

Narrator: Don't skip those vet appointments! We know they can be costly and time-consuming, but regular checkups are vital for preventative care.

Narrator: Many health problems are easier and cheaper to treat if caught early. Vets can detect subtle changes in your pet's health that you might miss.

Narrator: Puppies and kittens need more frequent visits for vaccinations and parasite prevention. Adult pets should have annual checkups, and senior pets may need to be seen twice a year. It allows your vet to track any potential decline or irregularities.

[MISTAKE #4: Using the Wrong Flea and Tick Prevention]

Narrator: Protecting your pet from fleas and ticks is crucial, but are you using the right products? This is a mistake many pet owners don't even realize they're making.

[VISUAL: Images of fleas and ticks, and a variety of flea and tick prevention products.]

Narrator: Over-the-counter treatments can be ineffective or even toxic, especially for cats. Never use dog flea and tick products on cats! This can cause severe neurological damage and even death.

Narrator: Always consult your veterinarian for recommendations on safe and effective flea and tick prevention. They can prescribe medications specifically tailored to your pet's needs and regional risks.

Narrator: Pay attention to the active ingredients in the product and any potential side effects. And number one might surprise you…

[MISTAKE #5: Ignoring Behavioral Changes]

Narrator: Finally, we're at number five: ignoring behavioral changes. A sudden shift in your pet's behavior can be a sign of underlying health issues.

[VISUAL: Split-screen: one side showing a happy, playful dog/cat, the other side showing a lethargic, withdrawn dog/cat.]

Narrator: Is your normally playful dog suddenly lethargic? Has your affectionate cat started hiding? These changes shouldn't be dismissed.

Narrator: Pain, illness, and even cognitive decline can manifest as behavioral changes. Keep a close eye on your pet's habits and routines.

Narrator: If you notice anything unusual, consult your veterinarian right away. Early intervention is key to improving your pet’s quality of life. Changes in water intake, appetite, sleeping patterns, or interaction with you are all red flags.
