Hey RichFinance fam! Are you leaving money on the table? Seriously. Every year, billions of dollars in tax credits and deductions go unclaimed, simply because people don't know about them. And with major tax changes potentially looming in 2026, now is the time to get your financial house in order! In this video, we’re going to break down 5 crucial tax moves you absolutely need to consider *before* that deadline hits. These aren’t just tips; they’re strategies that could save you serious cash. Stick around, because the longer you wait, the more you risk missing out!

## Chapter 1: Understanding the 2026 Tax Sunset (0:30-2:30)

Alright, let's talk about the elephant in the room: the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017. This massive piece of legislation brought sweeping changes to the tax code, and most of those changes are set to *sunset*, or expire, at the end of 2025. That means, come 2026, we could see a significant shift back to the pre-2018 tax landscape.

What does this actually MEAN for you? Well, several key provisions are at risk. Think about things like:

*   **Tax Brackets:** The TCJA lowered individual income tax rates across most brackets. If it sunsets, those rates could climb back up, meaning you’ll pay a higher percentage of your income in taxes. For example, someone in the 22% bracket now might find themselves back in the 25% or even higher bracket.

*   **The Standard Deduction:** The standard deduction was significantly increased under the TCJA, making it less necessary for many people to itemize. If it sunsets, the standard deduction will likely revert to lower levels. In 2024, the standard deduction for single filers is $14,600 and for married filing jointly it's $29,200. Without congressional action, these amounts will dramatically decrease.

*   **Child Tax Credit:** The TCJA expanded the Child Tax Credit, providing more relief to families. This credit could shrink significantly, impacting families with children.

*   **Estate Tax:** The TCJA also doubled the estate tax exemption. If it sunsets, fewer estates will be exempt from estate taxes.

Basically, the tax code could become more complex, and your tax liability could increase. The key takeaway here is: understand that the tax landscape is about to change, and proactive planning is crucial. Don't wait until the last minute to figure this out.

## Chapter 2: Maximize Retirement Contributions (2:30-4:30)

One of the most powerful tools for reducing your current-year tax burden is maximizing your contributions to tax-advantaged retirement accounts. This is true regardless of whether the TCJA sunsets or not, but it's especially important to consider now.

*   **401(k)s and 403(b)s:** If your employer offers a 401(k) or 403(b) plan, take full advantage of it. In 2024, you can contribute up to $23,000, or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older. These contributions are pre-tax, meaning they reduce your taxable income in the year you make them. Plus, your investments grow tax-deferred. If you’re not contributing enough to get the full employer match, you’re literally leaving free money on the table!

*   **Traditional IRAs:** Contributing to a Traditional IRA can also be a great way to lower your taxable income, especially if you're not covered by a retirement plan at work or if your income is below certain limits. For 2024, the contribution limit is $7,000, or $8,000 if you’re age 50 or older. These contributions are often tax-deductible.

*   **Health Savings Accounts (HSAs):** If you have a high-deductible health plan, consider contributing to a Health Savings Account. These accounts offer a triple tax advantage: contributions are tax-deductible, earnings grow tax-free, and withdrawals are tax-free if used for qualified medical expenses. The contribution limit for 2024 is $4,150 for individuals and $8,300 for families.

## Chapter 3: Tax-Loss Harvesting (4:30-6:30)

Tax-loss harvesting is a strategy that involves selling investments that have lost value to offset capital gains. This can reduce your overall tax liability and potentially even generate a tax deduction.

Here’s how it works:

1.  **Identify Losing Investments:** Review your investment portfolio and identify any stocks, bonds, or mutual funds that have decreased in value.

2.  **Sell the Losing Investments:** Sell those investments, realizing the capital loss.

3.  **Offset Capital Gains:** Use the capital loss to offset any capital gains you've realized during the year. For example, if you have a $5,000 capital gain and a $3,000 capital loss, you'll only be taxed on $2,000 of capital gains.

4.  **Deduct Excess Losses:** If your capital losses exceed your capital gains, you can deduct up to $3,000 of those losses against your ordinary income. Any remaining losses can be carried forward to future years.

**Important Note:** Be mindful of the "wash sale" rule. This rule prevents you from repurchasing the same or a substantially identical security within 30 days before or after the sale. If you violate the wash sale rule, the loss will be disallowed.

Tax-loss harvesting can be a complex strategy, so it's a good idea to consult with a tax professional to ensure you're doing it correctly.

## Chapter 4: Itemize Deductions Strategically (6:30-8:30)

As we discussed earlier, the higher standard deduction under the TCJA made itemizing less beneficial for many people. However, with the potential sunset of the TCJA, it’s crucial to re-evaluate whether itemizing makes sense for you.

Here are some common itemized deductions to consider:

*   **Medical Expenses:** You can deduct medical expenses that exceed 7.5% of your adjusted gross income (AGI). This can include things like doctor visits, hospital bills, prescription drugs, and health insurance premiums.

*   **State and Local Taxes (SALT):** You can deduct up to $10,000 in state and local taxes, including property taxes, income taxes, or sales taxes.

*   **Mortgage Interest:** You can deduct the interest you pay on your home mortgage, up to certain limits.

*   **Charitable Contributions:** You can deduct contributions you make to qualified charitable organizations. This can include cash donations, as well as donations of property.

*   **Business Expenses (for self-employed individuals):** If you're self-employed, you can deduct a variety of business expenses, such as office supplies, travel expenses, and professional fees.

**Tip:** Keep meticulous records of all your expenses. This will make it easier to determine whether itemizing is beneficial and to substantiate your deductions if you're audited.

## Chapter 5: Consider Roth Conversions (8:30-10:30)

A Roth conversion involves transferring funds from a traditional IRA or 401(k) to a Roth IRA. While you'll pay taxes on the converted amount in the year of the conversion, your future withdrawals in retirement will be tax-free.

Why consider a Roth conversion now?

*   **Potential for Higher Future Tax Rates:** If you believe that tax rates will be higher in the future (especially after the TCJA sunsets), converting to a Roth IRA now could save you money in the long run. You'll pay taxes on the conversion at today's rates, rather than potentially higher rates in retirement.

*   **Tax-Free Growth and Withdrawals:** Once the money is in a Roth IRA, it grows tax-free, and withdrawals in retirement are also tax-free. This can provide significant tax savings over time.

*   **Estate Planning Benefits:** Roth IRAs can also offer estate planning benefits. Your heirs won't have to pay income taxes on withdrawals from a Roth IRA.

**Important Consideration:** Roth conversions are generally best suited for individuals who expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement than they are currently. Also, you need to have funds available to pay the taxes on the converted amount.

## Bonus Tip: Review Your Withholding (10:30-11:30)

Don’t wait until tax season to realize you’ve underpaid! Review your W-4 form (Employee's Withholding Certificate) with your employer to ensure you’re withholding the correct amount of taxes from your paycheck. Life changes, like getting married, having a child, or starting a new job, can all impact your tax liability. Use the IRS's Tax Withholding Estimator tool on their website to help you determine the right amount to withhold. Avoiding underpayment penalties is always a smart move.
