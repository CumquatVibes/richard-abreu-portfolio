# YouTube SEO & Growth Optimization Notes
Source: TubeBuddy tutorials + best practices research

## Keyword Strategy
- **Long-tail keywords over broad terms** — target specific phrases (e.g., "photosynthesis explained for 8th graders" vs just "photosynthesis")
- Research keywords BEFORE creating content, not after
- Use keyword tools to find high search volume + low competition sweet spots
- Include grade level + subject in keywords for education content (e.g., "8th grade U.S. history")

## Title Optimization
- Front-load the most important keyword in the title
- Include the curiosity gap — make viewers feel they NEED to click
- Use numbers when possible ("5 Most Important...", "in 7 Minutes")
- Mix student language AND parent/teacher language for education content
  - Example: "Abraham Lincoln Explained for 8th Graders (U.S. History)" hits both audiences
- A/B test titles when possible

## Description Best Practices
- First 2-3 lines are most important (shown before "Show more")
- Include target keyword naturally in first sentence
- Add timestamps for longer videos
- Include links: study product, playlist, channel subscribe, social links
- Use full paragraph descriptions, not just keywords
- Include grade, subject, and key standards/keywords

## Tag Strategy
- **Put most relevant tags FIRST** — tag order matters
- Include: exact title, key topic, grade level, subject, related terms
- Use 10-15 tags per video
- Mix broad and specific: "civil war" + "civil war explained for 8th graders"
- Check what tags top-performing competitors use

## Thumbnail Rules
- Close-ups and clear compositions
- Must look great at both small AND large sizes
- Consistent branding across the channel
- High contrast colors
- 3-5 word text maximum
- For Rich Education: dark navy bg, gold highlights, silhouette icons

## Publishing Strategy
- **Consistency is more important than timing** — pick a schedule and stick to it
- Research audience activity patterns for optimal windows
- Schedule uploads in advance

## Growth Tactics
- Use end screens and cards consistently on every video
- Cross-promote between videos in descriptions
- Celebrate milestones to build community
- Analyze competitors in your niche
- Bulk update descriptions when adding new products/links

## Rich Education Specific
- Every video description should include:
  1. Hook line (first 2 sentences)
  2. Study product link with clear CTA
  3. Playlist link for binge-watching
  4. Grade + subject + key terms for search
  5. 5 check-yourself questions (drives engagement in comments)
  6. Affiliate link (where applicable)
  7. Channel subscribe link
