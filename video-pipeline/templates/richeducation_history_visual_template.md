# Rich Education — Generic K-12 History Video Visual Template

> You are helping me produce visuals for a faceless YouTube channel called **Rich Education**, which makes short explainer videos for K-12 students.
>
> I need a **visual shot list** for a video about:
> - **Topic:** [TOPIC]
> - **Grade level:** [GRADE]
> - **Subject:** [SUBJECT]
> - **Script section headings:** [PASTE THE SECTION HEADINGS FROM THE SCRIPT HERE]
>
> Use the structure below and fill in the visuals for each section. Keep everything age-appropriate, no graphic imagery, no copyrighted material.
>
> **For each section, provide:**
> 1. **Background:** What is shown behind the voiceover (map, illustration, simple texture, color, etc.)
> 2. **Visual beats:** Specific things that appear on screen as the voiceover hits key points (icons, labels, timelines, animations, maps lighting up, etc.)
> 3. **On-screen text:** Short, punchy phrases or labels that appear (3-6 words max per phrase)
> 4. **Transition suggestion:** How to move to the next section (simple fade, color shift, map zoom, etc.)
>
> **Rules for every video:**
> - Use a consistent **color palette**: dark background (#1a1a2e or similar), gold/yellow highlights for key terms, white body text, and red/blue for opposing sides if applicable.
> - Use **simple silhouette-style illustrations** — no real photos of real people, no graphic war scenes.
> - Use **map-based visuals** wherever geography is relevant (light up states, regions, routes, etc.)
> - Every video ends with a **recap slide** (3 bullet points) and a **"check yourself" question box** (5 questions, numbered).
> - Keep the visual style consistent so every Rich Education video looks like it belongs to the same channel.
>
> **Section structure to follow (match the script):**
>
> - **Section 1 - Hook (0:00-0:30):** Title card + confusion-to-clarity visual transition
> - **Section 2 - Background / Early context (~1 min):** Timeline bar + key label icons
> - **Section 3 - Path to the problem (~1 min):** Simple cause-and-effect visual flow
> - **Section 4 - The big problem (~1.5 min):** Map or split-screen showing conflict or tension
> - **Section 5 - Key actions / events (~2 min):** Document, map, or character visual beats tied to script
> - **Section 6 - Impact / Legacy (~1 min):** Brighter tone, "what changed" visual recap
> - **Section 7 - Recap & check-yourself (~45 sec):** Split-screen recap bullets + numbered question boxes
>
> **Output format:**
> Give me each section as a numbered block with the 4 fields (Background, Visual beats, On-screen text, Transition). Be specific enough that a video editor or AI image tool can execute each shot without guessing.

## How to use this

Every time you start a new history video:

1. Paste the prompt above into Claude.
2. Fill in `[TOPIC]`, `[GRADE]`, `[SUBJECT]`.
3. Paste in the section headings from the script Claude already wrote.
