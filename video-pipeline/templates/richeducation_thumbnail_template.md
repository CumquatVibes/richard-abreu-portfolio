# Rich Education — Thumbnail Template Prompt

> You are helping me design YouTube thumbnails for a faceless K-12 educational channel called **Rich Education**.
>
> Generate a **thumbnail design brief** for this video:
> - **Topic:** [TOPIC]
> - **Grade level:** [GRADE]
> - **Subject:** [SUBJECT]
> - **Video title:** [FULL VIDEO TITLE]
>
> **Brand rules (apply to every thumbnail):**
> - **Background:** Deep dark navy or charcoal (#1a1a2e or #12121f), never white or light backgrounds.
> - **Accent color:** Gold/yellow (#f5c518 or similar) for the most important word or number.
> - **Text color:** Bright white for main text, gray for secondary text.
> - **Font style:** Bold, blocky, easy to read at small size (think Impact or a heavy sans-serif).
> - **No real photos of real people.** Use simple silhouette illustrations, icons, or stylized graphics only.
> - **Channel watermark area:** Leave a small bottom-left corner clear for the "Rich Education" logo badge.
> - **Thumbnail size:** 1280 x 720px (standard YouTube).
>
> **Thumbnail structure to follow:**
>
> 1. **Focal visual (center or left 60% of image):**
>    - A simple, bold illustration or icon that represents the topic at a glance.
>    - Examples: Lincoln silhouette with top hat, a broken chain, a map of the U.S., a DNA strand, a math formula on a chalkboard, etc.
>    - Keep it clean -- one main visual, not a collage.
>
> 2. **Main headline text (right side or overlaid, large):**
>    - 3-5 words MAX.
>    - Use the most searchable, curiosity-triggering words from the title.
>    - Highlight 1 key word in gold/yellow.
>    - Example: "Who Was **LINCOLN**?" or "Civil War **EXPLAINED**"
>
> 3. **Sub-label or grade badge (small, top or bottom corner):**
>    - A small pill/badge shape with text like "8th Grade" or "U.S. History" or "5 Min Explainer."
>    - Color: dark background with gold text or white text.
>
> 4. **Emotion/curiosity trigger:**
>    - Add one visual element that creates a "wait, what?" feeling:
>      - A question mark overlaid on the main visual.
>      - A "myth vs. truth" style split (optional, only if topic fits).
>      - A bold contrast (e.g., Lincoln silhouette on one side, broken chains on the other).
>      - A magnifying glass icon over a key image to imply "let's look closer."
>
> **Output format:**
> Give me the thumbnail brief as follows:
>
> - **Background:** [describe exactly]
> - **Focal visual:** [describe exactly -- what it looks like, where it sits, style]
> - **Main headline text:** [exact words, which word is highlighted in gold]
> - **Sub-label/badge:** [exact text, color, placement]
> - **Emotion trigger:** [what it is, where it goes]
> - **Overall mood:** [1 sentence describing the vibe]
> - **Midjourney / image gen prompt:** [a ready-to-use prompt for generating the focal visual]
